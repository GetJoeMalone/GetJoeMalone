<h1> Bikeshare Project</h1> 

<p> I utilized publicly available data from a bike sharing service in New York City to do data analysis for a fictional restaurant with a location near a station.
I imagine the client would send an email something like this...</p>

<h3> Excerpt from email </h3> 
<p> "We always see people coming and going from the bike station and are wondering if we might be missing an opportunity to reach more customers. We have customers of all types, but our bar makes a lot of our revenue and the crowd is mostly 20-something to 40-something. We have a great nightime crowd (midnight to 3am is super busy). We would love to get the bar filled earlier in the day, as well. Do you think you can help?
